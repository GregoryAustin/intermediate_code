# COS 341 Project 3

## Build and Run

To build, execute `make` in the root directory. Ensure that the `out/` directory exists. To run, execute `make run` followed by the input file, such as `make run examples/test2.txt`. To remove the class and output files, run `make clean`.

An intermediate file will be created if the spl program compiles. It's called spl.basic
To run it spl.basic, type in: ./basic spl.basic 

## TODO: 
1. src/codegen/Codegen.java is capable of converting everything except for functions (so we need todo that). 
2. Testing of Codegen.java
2. The pruning, i.e., project 3c
